## Demo Videos

- This is a short demo of how to create and utilize a deployment yaml file for an Azure function app to an existing Kubernetes service. Also, we show another option of deploying directly to Kubernetes from a Docker container residing on the Azure Container Registry. Lastly, we tour through our deployment running on a Kubernetes service with the Azure portal.
